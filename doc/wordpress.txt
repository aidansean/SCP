<h3>Overview</h3>

The SCP Wiki is description of a fictional emergency containment facility.  This project collects mostly attempts at writing articles, and anything else relevant to the SCP, including the python script.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<dl>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: The python script has to make an HTTP request and keep the user entertained while it handles the request.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: This was the first time I used python with HTTP requests, which turned out to be quite easy.  The script produces a series of messages to emulate the security steps needed to access the articles. (Resolved)</dd>
<dt><em>Challenge</em>: It would be nice to have ASCII images appear.</dt>

<dd><em>Solution</em>: Most SCP articles contain small images, and I've already worked with <a href="http://aidansean.com/projects/?p=17">ASCII art</a> elsewhere, so it should be a matter of putting the two together, when I get time. (To be done)</dd>
