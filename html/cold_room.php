      Object Class: Safe</p>
      <h3>Special Containment Procedures</h3>
      
      <p>SCP-XXXX is located on the fourth floor of building 38 of the ██████████ Theoretical and Solid State physics Laboratory, ██████████, Germany.  Access to SCP-XXXX can only be granted by Personnel level 4 or higher.  No person may work in SCP-XXXX for longer than 45 minutes in any 24 hour period and all personnel who come into contact with SCP-XXXX must undergo a medical examination with 36 hours of leaving.  Academic staff on site are not permitted to enter building 38 at any time.  The signage on the building has been changed to make it look like a decommissioned experimental hall which is a radiation hazard.  Radioactive waste for the laboratory is stored in its lower levels.</p>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>SCP-XXXX is a region of space contained mostly within a room measuring 25.0948723 m x 10.0040985 m x 3.4098676 m with the anomalous property that it suppresses background noise.  This condition was first noticed in June 1974, shortly after the building was erected, when scientific staff were conducting experiments to measure the cosmic microwave background and found the signal with unprecedented low levels of background noise.  Due to the nature of their results, the publication of this work was rejected during peer review as it was found to irreproducible.  Further studies have showed that the experiments in the room are not subject to acoustic noise, thermal noise, or background radiation levels.  Experimental apparatus have measured the magnetic field of the Earth to a precision of X nT, placed limits on natural radiation levels to be lower than Y pSv per hour.  There are claims that a Copper-Iridium room temperature superconductor had been developed within SCP-XXXX.  The dimensions of the room were measured using laser based interferometry, and this study was found to be limited by the atomic clock apparatus provided.  Further improvements in precision are in principle possible, but were not deemed a productive use of resources.</p>
      
      <p>Due to the anomalous nature of the room any exposure to its effects is detrimental to health, with effects becoming evident within an hour of entry to SCP-XXXX.  Any persons working in the room will not experience mild hunger, thirst, fatigue, or confusion.  Any minor ailments such as norovirus will not show any symptoms and minor cuts or grazes will not produce any pain.  Persons in the room cannot sweat, pass gas, and do not experience normal rapid eye movement.  As a result of the lack of mundane bodily functions, ≈upon leaving SCP-XXXX people often experience negative side effects, including: migraines, nausea, involuntary defecation, painful gas (in some cases leading to ruptured organs), acute cardiac failure, acute renal failure, sudden bleeding of wounds sustained in the room, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], and [REDACTED].  The first instance of a fatality caused by SCP-XXXX occurred in September 1975 when a student suffering from a mild throat infection worked in the room for several hours.  Upon leaving the room the tissue in her throat swelled, cutting off her air supply.  An emergency tracheostomy was successfully performed to restore airflow, but she died later that day due to the extent to which the infection had spread across her body.  It was at this time that the Foundation became aware of the anomaly and condemned the building as a radiation hazard.</p>
      
      <p>Tests have been performed to investigate the effects of the room on different objects.  A common house cat was locked in the room with food and water for several weeks.  The cat did not consume any nutrition for the first five days, at which point it drank some water.  Three days later it died due to dehydration.  An autopsy revealed many injuries to the cat's feet and joints caused by normal movement.</p>
      
      <p>Class D personnel D-4987 was instructed to spend a night in SCP-XXXX.  He was equipped with a sleeping bag, an alarm clock, and adequate rations.  Subject reported having trouble getting to sleep due to the room being completely quiet, dark, and with no variation of temperature.  The following morning subject woke up several hours after the alarm clock sounded, and reported having slept very well.  Upon leaving SCP-XXXX it was discovered that subject had bedsores which had been bleeding and weeping pus for several hours, and required medical attention.</p>
      
      <p>A commercial "Roomba" robot was stationed in the room with a power supply.  A video camera was placed in room to monitors its progress.  The robot functioned for 34 days without any problems, but collected no debris.  The battery sustained mild damage due to overcharging.  The video feed was very clear when viewed within SCP-XXXX.  However when the camera was removed from SCP-XXXX the video appeared to suffer from significant light pollution and static in the audio channels.</p>
      
      <p>A common sunflower was placed in SCP-XXXX.  Although SCP-XXXX does not contain any windows, the sunflower successfully followed the position of the sun in sky.  This continued for several weeks until eventually the sunflower died due to lack of adequate lighting.</p>
