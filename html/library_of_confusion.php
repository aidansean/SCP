      <p>Item #: SCP-XXXX<br /><br />
      Object Class: Safe</p>
      <h3>Special Containment Procedures</h3>
      
      <p>SCP-XXXX is currently locked in a standard containment chamber at site 28. Copies of SCP-XXXX are available to any personnel on request.</p>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>SCP-XXXX is a collection of antique documents, including 583 maps, 1202 historical documents, and 34 works of poetry and dramatic works. SCP-XXXX was recovered from the library of an abandoned mansion in ████████████, CT, USA is 195█. Copies of SCP-XXXX have been studied in detail and are found to be of very high accuracy and have been useful in many academic studies.</p>
      
      <p>Study of the original documents has two side effects. The immediate effect is to increase a sense of curiosity in the content of the documents. When exposed to a single document (a map of New York City from 1902) a test subject spent 4.5 hours studying the document before reluctantly being removed from the room with the application of some force. When presented with a replica of the same document another test subject got bored after studying it for 3 minutes. When presented with the original document the same test subject sat for over 2 hours studying it before being forcibly removed.</p>
      
      <p>The second effect is only noticeable in the following weeks. A test subject will be unable to process new information in a coherent manner, although they will not be aware of this effect. They will be able to recall a similar amount of information as a normal person, but the factual accuracy will be very unreliable. This is demonstrated in the following log:
      
      <blockquote>
      SCP-XXXX log 1<br />
      Dr ██████: Can you describe what happened when you looked at the documents from SCP-XXXX?<br />
      D-1938: I was in the SCP-XXXX room, the uh, library, and I was looking at what was there.<br />
      Dr ██████: How long were you there and what did you look at?<br />
      D-1938: I spent three days there. I was allowed to sleep in a room nearby, which was very nice because I wanted to spend a long time in there. I was mostly looking at the plays of Elderman and astronomical studies of de Large. Did you know that passage of Mars…<br />
      Dr ██████: Please answer the following questions. You studied SCP-XXXX 23 days ago. What did you do since that time?<br />
      D-1938: For the first week I stayed on site and mostly played tennis. Then I travelled to Venice for a few days. It was very nice but the weather was very bad. Then I had to eat meatloaf for a week. I didn't like that.<br />
      Dr ██████: Why did you go to Venice?<br />
      D-1938: My daughter called me up and told me that a chimpanzee had escaped from a zoo and the mayor had to resign. I had a cold that day and so we went to the hospital.<br />
      Dr ██████: Why did you go to Venice?<br />
      D-1938: I had a Mars bar. There was wrestling on the TV and then the doctor said there was bad news. I couldn't open the door because I lost the keys, they were down the back of the sofa.<br />
      Dr ██████: Why did you go to Venice?<br />
      D-1938: I was at the cinema because I couldn't use my wrist anymore. My daughter found out I was sleeping with a hooker, which was very embarrassing. We went to Venice the next day.<br />
      Dr ██████: Is that what you really think happened in the past three weeks?<br />
      D-1938: Yes. I already told you all this.<br />
      Dr ██████: Here is a written record prepared by Dr ███ who has been monitoring your behaviour, as you know. "D-1938 continued his daily duties for several days. After four days he expressed an interest in tennis and started to play on-site in the afternoons. Due to an injury to his right arm sustained while playing tennis he was taken to a local hospital. It was found that his wrist was sprained and put into a splint. He showed signs of concussion and amnesia, and was asked to stay overnight. His daughter came to visit and they watched television. Interview with his daughter reveals that they watched the local news with a report about the Mayor's resignation and an incident at the local zoo. Upon leaving the hospital D-1938 was unable to play tennis in the afternoon so he visited the cinema instead. One afternoon I told him about my vacation in Venice while we ate meatloaf in the cafeteria. We agreed to meet for lunch the next day, but D-1938 was late, claiming he couldn't find his keys. We had meatloaf again and I asked him to report to Dr ██████ for an interview." What do you have to say about that?<br />
      D-1938: Well, that's what I told you.<br />
      Dr ██████: You said you went to Venice, but you didn't. Dr ███ went to Venice and told you about it.<br />
      D-1938: Right.<br />
      Dr ██████: So why did you say you went to Venice?<br />
      D-1938: I did go to Venice.<br />
      Dr ██████: And Dr ███ told you about his vacation?<br />
      D-1938: He told me about my vacation. It was only a few hours ago.<br />
      Dr ██████: It was four days ago.
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>D-1938 continued to mix up his memories and retained inconsistent information for another two weeks before his capacity to form meaningful memories returned. Any new information learned during the five week period contained conflicts and internal inconsistencies. For example D-1938 took a short history course and despite numerous attempts to persuade him otherwise, D-1938 is convinced that in 1815 Columbus cured polio.</p>
      
      <p>Due to the cognito hazards posed by SCP-XXXX no personnel who has had direct contact with any of the documents that make up SCP-XXXX can work on any Euclid or Keter SCPs without appropriate psychological testing.</p>
