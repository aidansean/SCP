      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>SCP-XXXX is a commercial laptop computer with a program called "Weather the Storm", operating under Windows 7.  This program claims to be able to predict the weather at any point on the Earth with >99% accuracy up to three months from the present day, depending on the geographical location under consideration.  Request for reports can be automated, with a default frequency of one report per day per region of interest.  SCP-XXXX does not need to be connected to the internet to provide reports, and despite all methods of connection (wifi, bluetooth, ethernet) having been disabled permanently, is still capable of producing reports.  Tests of the reports have shown that the predictions of cloud cover, precipitation, temperature, pressure, humidity, and seismic activity match the actual data in 99.85% of all cases.</p>
      
      <p>Reports from SCP-XXXX have be used to successfully predict two earthquakes, one tsunami, three hurricanes, seventeen forest or brush fires, 134 lightning storms, and 38 serious incidents of flooding across the world over an eight week period.  The cumulative death toll of these incidents was in excess of 35,000 people.  Warnings of these events were shared with local authorities, and humanitarian organisations estimate that without these warnings the death toll would have been in excess of 500,000 people.  Statistical analysis of the reports show the following result: When a report is requested for a given region at a given time, the probability of an extreme meteorological or seismological event taking place is 7.8 times larger than normal, and the number of fatalities is 25 times higher than normal.  As a result it is believed that SCP-XXXX is not predicting these events, but causing them.  All future testing is therefore forbidden until further notice.</p>
