      <p>Item #: SCP-XXXX<br /><br />
      Object Class: Safe</p>
      <h3>Special Containment Procedures</h3>
      
      <p>SCP-XXXX is contained in a biological containment chamber fitted with a pool of water.  Food is to provided daily, and the containment chamber is to be cleaned every 30 days.  When there are more than fifty adult specimens present, a cull should be carried out until 10-20 male and female specimens remain.  The expired specimens are to be burned immediately.  Only class D personnel may enter the chamber, and must wear standard biological protective clothing.  Anyone infected by SCP-XXXX spores is to be detained and quarantined without delay, and when they expire, their body is to be incinerated.</p>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>SCP-XXXX is a flock of many infected common ducks (Anas platyrhynchos domestica) which, apart from their anomalous properties, appear normal.  The feathers of a specimen of SCP-XXXX are coated with a fungus, which exists in a symbiotic relationship with the duck.  Separately, the fungus and a duck do not have any special properties.  In the presence of the fungus the fertility of the ducks increases, leading to a breeding season every 35 days, and a typical clutch size of 22 eggs.  When the fungus comes into contact with other animal matter, it secretes microscopic spores, typically releasing hundreds of spores in a single event.</p>
      
      <p>Upon making contact, these spores move through the host's skin, making contact with the host's bloodstream.  They then propagate to different regions of the host and deposit duck ova.  Over the course of 9 days these ova will grow into ducklings, using the host's body as an incubator and connecting directly to the host's bloodstream via a rudimentary umbilical cord.  Removal of ova can be fatal, due to resulting blood loss and sepsis.  Ova at the core of the host's body do not lead to viable instances of SCP-XXXX, but often lead to organ failure of the host.  Ova near the surface of the skin cause the skin to dry out and harden.  These ova will eventually hatch, giving rise to new instances of SCP-XXXX infants, which are clones of their parents.  Within a few hours of hatching the umbilical cords connecting these ducklings to the host will fall off, and the new instances of SCP-XXXX will act like normal ducklings.  To date no infected hosts have survived interaction with SCP-XXXX spores.</p>
