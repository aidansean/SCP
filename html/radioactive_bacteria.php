      <p>Item #: SCP-XXXX<br /><br />
      Object Class: Safe</p>
      <h3>Special Containment Procedures</h3>
      
      <p>SCP-XXXX must be contained in a room hermetically lined with at least 0.5 m of lead or 2.5 m of concrete at all times. Personnel are to wear standard biohazard protective clothing when working with SCP-XXXX specimens, which should be disposed of in a radioactive waste dump. Radiation sensors are fitted near each instance of SCP-XXXX and are monitored remotely. Signifncant changes in readings are to be noted and reported.</p>
      
      <p>Any persons affected by SCP-XXXX must be quarantined in a radiation resistant chamber, and must not be allowed direct contact with any other living entity. Upon death the chamber must remain locked until the body can be safely burned.</p>
      
      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>SCP-XXXX consists of 36 samples of bacteria culture (SCP-XXXX-1, through SCP-XXXX-36) arranged on several labatory work stations, each equipped with radiation sensors which are attached to two redundant servers. Each sample contains a slightly different strain of bacteria which share similar characteristics. A typical strain has a life cycle of extended dormancy, lasting from several weeks to several years, followed by a reproductive period which can last between several minutes and up to 48 hours. During the reproductive cycle the strains of bacteria emit large amounts of ionising radiation, ranging in energies from 5 eV to 8000 eV, with an average rate of dose of 12 Bq per bacterium. Following reproduction the bacteria remain dormant, passing through several other hosts until the "target" host species is reached, at which point the life cycle repeats.</p>
      
      <p>Due to the high levels of radiation during the reproductive period, strains of SCP-XXXX are radiation hard relative to other bacteria, and capable of rapid mutation.  Strains of SCP-XXXX show increased immunity to common antibiotics, and heat resistance up to temperatures of 80&deg;C. Most strains are adapted to particular host species, with host species including aquatic flora, deep sea fish, sea birds and (for the most recent strains) agricultural flora and land mammals.</p>
      
      <p>The first known instance of SCP-XXXX was found on the island of ████████ in the Pacific Ocean in June 201█. Hauls from local fishing boats were found to be contaminated with SCP-XXXX-1 following the deaths of eight villagers. Autopsies revealed high levels of radiation, consistent with a reproductive period of SCP-XXXX, although the public was informed that the deaths were due to Mercury poisoning. During the following months more strains of SCP-XXXX were discovered in various host species including gulls, seaweed, and two species of fern. Despite efforts to contain and quarantine the area, strains have been found in cow and sheep hosts, as well as two strains adapted to human hosts. In one case the life cycle is as normal, and the host experiences rapid radiation sickness over the course of several days, which is fatal in all cases, and dangerous to all those around. In the other case the strain enters the blood stream and attaches itself to the spinal column and close to the brain stem. The reproductive period for this strain is less intense and lasts several weeks. Common symptoms include muscle spasms, pain radiating from the lower back and along limbs, memory loss, irritability, seizures, acute radiation sickness, and in the final stages, open wounds developing on the back. These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and produce large amounts of radioactive pus. Hosts die either from other opportunistic infections, or chronic radiation sickness.</p>
