    <h3>About this page</h3>
    <div class="blurb">
      <p>SCP stands for Special Containment Procedure.  Or Secure, Contain and Protect.  Or Secure CoPy.  I don't really know or care what it stands for.  The SCP is a <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net/">wiki</a> of special instructions for containing objects which are of interest to <a href="">The Foundation</a>.  Writing these instructions proves to be a fascinating and rewarding exercise in creative writing, and a good way to practice one's horror writing skills.</p>

      <p>For fun I wrote a simple python script that downloads and displays the text for a given SCP page in the terminal.  This way I can get a laugh whenever I wait for some code to run.  For best effect, this should be piped into less.  It takes one argument which can be:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An SCP number (eg "914"): that SCP description gets written to the terminal.</li>
        <li>A log name, (eg "experiment-log-914"): that log file gets written to the terminal.</li>
        <li>An empty string: a random SCP description gets written to the terminal.</li>
        <li>"help": this help text gets written to the terminal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><a href="scp.py.text">Get the script</a></p>

        <a href="fire_pencils.php"><img class="icon" src="/images/scp_fire_pencils.png" alt="Fire pencils" /></a>
      </div>
      <p>This is the first SCP I wrote.  They are pencils that (eventually) set fire to anything they write on.  I didn't have time to respond to queries, so the votes went up, then went down, then it got removed from the wiki.  I may resurrect it one day, as I liked the idea quite a lot.  <a href="fire_pencils.php">Burn, baby, burn.</a></p>

      <p>This SCP compels people to remove one of their eyes and stick it to a wall.  I have no idea where it came from or why the idea occurred to me, but it is creepy.  <a href="eye_museum.php">Eye see what you did there.</a></p>

      <p>This is sand that multiplies in mass and volume without warning.  It my have been the origin of the Sahara desert.  It tends to destroy anything in its path unless it faces sufficient resistance, which can vary without knowing how much pressure is needed.  <a href="expanding_sand.php">There's something in my eye.</a></p>

      <p>This SCP is bacteria that has a long dormant phase.  Then when it reproduces it kills its host by emitting huge amounts of radiation.  It's also immune to antibiotics.  Enjoy.  <a href="radioactive_bacteria.php">It's a nuke kind of infection.</a></p>

    <h3>Initial ideas</h3>
    <div class="blurb">
      <p>Here are some ideas that need some further development.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strike>Something use this image: <a href="http://imgur.com/r/funny/G42c97N">Scary duckface.  Seriously, WTF is that?</a>.</strike></li>
        <li>A teapot that lets you travel through time, but takes the time difference off your life span, leading to instant death on return.</li>
        <li>The axiom problem.  There's the axiom associated with countable sets that seems to have beaten all attempts of a proof of its truth.  What if the proof requires you be in a state of mind that leads to homicidal rage and 50% of people who find a proof find the axiom to be true, and the other 50% find it to be false?</li>
        <li>Google auto-awesome predicts your death.  Pretty simple really: when you upload some similar photos Google animates them.  One of the photos is a bit off and predicts the imminent death of one of those in the photo.</li>
        <li>The data bunker, a self-assembled network of servers that store information from the internet and seems to go on for hundreds of server rooms.  It somehow makes enough money to employ staff for upgrades, repairs, spare parts etc and just keeps increasing in size.  Nobody really knows how it started and nobody wants to turn it off in case bad stuff happens to the internet.</li>
        <li>Room flooder.  Just an ordinary guy who induces huge amounts of rain that can be drained away for no known reason.  He spends all his waking hours outrunning the floods and is perpetually sleep deprived.  Poor guy.</li>
        <li><strike>Ancient documents of wonder.  A collection of old documents (maps, poems, historical records etc) that are all historically accurate and useful.  Whomever reads them has the effect that that cannot learn anything new in a consistent manner.</strike></li>
        <li>Exploding glass.  It's a lifeform that lives in glass and infects any glass it comes into contact with.  It propagates itself by building up gas and then exploding, showering very sharp shards of glass everywhere.</li>
      </ul>
