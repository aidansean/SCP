      <p>Item #: SCP-XXXX<br /><br />
      Object Class: Safe</p>
<p>The room containing SCP-XXXX must remain locked at all times. Entrance can only be granted via a double retinal scanning apparatus. Upon granting access to SCP-XXXX, medical personnel are alerted and there is a 15 minute cool-off period during which the door will remain locked. The emergency annex must be maintained with adequate medical provisions. (Minimal requirements are: bandages, antibiotics, sedatives.) These supplies must not be used for any other purpose. The drainage system must be checked regularly for blockages.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>SCP-XXXX consists of a medical supply trolley with the top shelf containing one mirror, one scalpel, one ocular speculum and one towel. The lower shelf contains special apparatus for mounting human tissue to hard surfaces. The walls of the room accommodate a collection of human eyes, arranged at approximately eye level. At the time of writing there are 182 human eyes on display. Despite a lack of preservation apparatus, the eyes do not appear to age or decay in any way.<br />
<br />
Upon entering the room, any person is overcome with an intense sense of curiosity with respect to the eyes on display. Subjects have been seen spending up to several hours looking at the eyes, with some subjects taking notes, photographs, engaging in conversations with other subjects etc. Before the leaving the room, the subject approaches SCP-XXXX and willingly, and with great care uses the tools available to donate one of their own eyes to the collection, often spending several minutes selecting the best location on the walls of the room. Many subjects continue to browse the collection after donating one of their eyes, and many will also attempt to clean up residual tissue from the auto-ocular extraction procedure. The subject will remain calm and speak positively of the visit to the room until they leave, at which point they become fully aware of their actions and the consequences of their actions. In most cases their mood changes dramatically and the subject may need to be sedated before medical care can be administered to prevent further damage.<br />
<br />
The base of SCP-XXXX appears to contain a self-cleaning and sterilising procedure. One hour after each extraction procedure the apparatus of SCP-XXXX will be returned to its original state, with excess tissue and bodily fluids removed and deposited into a custom built drainage chute for extraction.<br />
<br />
All attempts to reattach eyes have resulted in failure and generally lead to further loss of tissue. Subjects returning to reclaim their tissue will, if not stopped, proceed to donate a second specimen. Physical intervention in such cases is not recommended.

<h3>Log of incident SCP-1874-I1</h3>
<p>Two days after the arrival of SCP-1874 (██/██/████) Drs A█████ and T██████ requested access to SCP-1874 for research purposes.</p>

<p>
(Drs A█████ and T██████ are standing outside the chamber.)<br />
Dr A█████: Okay, let's get this over with.<br />
(Dr A█████ enters the chamber.)<br />
Dr A█████: Wow, this is neat.  Come see this.<br />
Dr T██████: Okay, give me a minute, I still need to...<br />
Dr A█████: No seriously, you don't want to miss this.<br />
Dr T██████: Fine, but I don't see what could be so (Dr T██████ enters the chamber)... Oh.  I see.<br />
Dr A█████: Look at these eyes.  There's a blue one, and a brown one.<br />
Dr T██████: This one is bloodshot.<br />
(Conversation continues for another 16 minutes)<br />
(Dr T██████ moves to SCP-1874-1 and starts to remove his right eye.)<br />
Dr T██████: Easy does it.<br />
(After 150 seconds Dr T██████ has removed his eye.)<br />
Dr T██████: Where should I put this?<br />
Dr A█████: What color is it?<br />
Dr T██████: Bluey-green.<br />
Dr A█████: Over here.  The rest of these eyes are mostly brown.<br />
(Dr T██████ attaches his eye to the wall where Dr A█████ suggested.)<br />
Dr T██████: It looks good.<br />
Dr A██████: Okay, I should probably leave a donation too.<br />
(Dr A█████ moves to SCP-1874-1 and starts to remove his left eye.)<br />
Dr A█████: This is harder than it looks.<br />
Dr T██████: You have to go around the side, like this.<br />
(Dr T██████ approaches Dr A█████ and assists the procedure.)<br />
(Dr A█████ attaches his eye to the wall.)<br />
Dr A█████: Right, I've seen enough, let's go.<br />
Dr T██████: I'm going to take a photo first.<br />
(Dr T██████ removes a camera from his bag and holds it to his empty eye socket.)<br />
Dr T██████: (laughing) Wrong eye.<br />
(Dr T██████ takes a photograph of his eye.  Drs A█████ and T██████ sign the guest book, then leave the containment chamber.)<br />
Dr T██████: (Yells in pain)<br />
Dr A█████: (Yells also) My eye!  My good eye!<br />
Dr T██████: Argh, what the-<br />
Dr A█████: I need to get it back!<br />
(Dr A█████ re-enters the chamber.  His mood changes to a more relaxed state.  He looks at his eye on the wall, then proceeds to remove his right eye.  He attempts to attach it to the wall, walking with difficulty and affixing it to the wall rather lower than the rest.  He feels his way back to the door and leaves without signing the guest book.)<br />
Dr A█████: Oh god!  What did I just do that for?<br />
Dr T██████: This fucking deathtrap needs a warning or something!</p>

<p>Following incident SCP-1874-I1 a double retinal scanner was added to the door to prevent people with one eye entering the chamber.  A week later the 15 minute cool-off period was added to further discourage reentry.</p>

<h3>Log of incident SCP-1874-I2</h3>
<p>A blind member of class D personnel was asked to enter the containment chamber.  The retinae of Dr S█████ were scanned to gain entry.  Upon entering he proceeded to walk with difficulty to SCP-1874-1 and remove his left eye.  He affixed it to the wall immediately to the left of the door frame before leaving the room.</p>

<h3>Log of incident SCP-1874-I3</h3>
<p>A member of class D personnel who had two previous experiences with SCP-1874 was asked to enter a third time.  She reported feeling no strong feelings of compulsion.  She reported feeling a mixture of boredom and resentment.  She left without approaching SCP-1874-1 or the guest book.</p>

<h3>Log of incident SCP-1874-I4</h3>
<p>A member of class D personnel was fitted with a helmet to prevent access to his eyes.  Upon entering the room he attempted to remove his left eye through the glass at the of the helmet.  After failing to do so he repeatedly hit his head against the door until the helmet was sufficiently damaged and the glass broken.  He proceeded to remove his left eye before signing the guest book and leaving.  As a result of his injuries the subject suffered severe concussion and permanent damage to his remaining eye.
